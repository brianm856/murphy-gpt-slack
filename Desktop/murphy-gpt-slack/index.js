================= FOLLOW UP BOSS LEAD MANAGEMENT SOP =================
üéØ Purpose
Establish consistent daily/weekly practices in Follow Up Boss (FUB) that reflect Murphy Group standards for speed, service, and conversion. Move every lead from new contact to closed client with urgency.

üö® Critical Requirement
- Use ONLY your FUB phone number and MG email for all communication (no personal phones/emails/apps).
- Calls, texts, and voicemails must log via FUB automatically.
- Install the FUB app and enable notifications.

üìÇ Lead Stages & Definitions
- Lead ‚Üí New in FUB; not yet contacted.
- Attempted Contact ‚Üí At least 3 attempts (call/text/email); no connection yet.
- Spoke with Customer ‚Üí Contact made; notes must include timeline, motivation, and follow-up plan.
- Appointment Set ‚Üí Showing/consult/CMA scheduled; include date/time; add to calendar.
- Met with Customer ‚Üí Appointment occurred; update outcome + next step.
- Showing Homes ‚Üí Actively showing a buyer; follow up after every showing.
- Listing Agreement ‚Üí Seller signed; pre-list process begins.
- Active Listing ‚Üí Live on MLS; weekly updates + marketing notes required.
- Submitting Offers ‚Üí Offers written/submitted; log outcomes/negotiations.
- Under Contract ‚Üí Include key dates (closing, inspection, contingencies).
- Nurture ‚Üí Long-term; assign action plan + next follow-up.
- Closed ‚Üí Deal complete; tag "Closed"; final note for testimonial/referral.
- Trash ‚Üí Unqualified/out of market/unresponsive after multiple attempts; include reason note.

üïí Daily Expectations
- Start of day: check New Leads (Lead), Overdue Tasks, hot opportunities (Showing, Listing Agreement, Submitting Offers).
- Respond to NEW LEADS within 5 minutes.
- Complete overdue tasks; work Smart Lists (Zillow, Buyer Active, Seller Active, etc.).

‚òéÔ∏è First Contact Protocol
- Call within 5 minutes ‚Üí if no answer, text ‚Üí followed by email if applicable.
- Make at least 3 attempts on Day 1.
- Update stage to Attempted Contact or Spoke with Customer and log results.

üìÜ Weekly Workflow
- Monday Pipeline Audit: review Spoke w/ Customer, Appointment Set, Showing, Listing Agreement, Submitting Offers ‚Üí ensure clear notes, follow-up plan, correct stage/action plan ‚Üí move stale to Nurture/Trash w/ notes.
- Friday Follow-Up: touch all Active Buyers/Sellers; confirm weekend showings/open houses; log feedback + next steps.

üßº Lead Hygiene
- No one should sit in "Lead" or "Spoke with Customer" longer than necessary.
- Every lead must have: accurate stage, action plan, next task, and a note ‚â§ 7 days old (or timeline-appropriate).
- Trash requires a reason note.

üí¨ Notes & Comms
- Log every call/text/meeting same day.
- Notes include: date, summary, motivation/timeline, next step.
- Use MG-branded templates; personalize every message.

üèÜ Accountability
- Weekly review: speed to lead, conversations logged, pipeline movement, notes/task completion, overall conversion.
- FUB is the source of truth‚Äîif it‚Äôs not in FUB, it didn‚Äôt happen.

===================== LEAD CONVERSION SOP =====================
Purpose: Maximize relationships, appointment setting, and long-term business through consistent execution.

1) Lead Response Standards
- Speed to Lead: contact within 5 minutes (non-negotiable).
- Attempts: call 7 times in the first 7 days; "no answer" ‚â† disinterest.
- Business Comms: use FUB number + MG email only.

2) Video Communication
- Send a personalized video to every new lead (BombBomb, Loom, or FUB video).
- Purpose: reduce skepticism, build trust, humanize.

3) Follow-Up Protocol
- Contacted Leads: follow up 2√ó/month indefinitely.
- Past Clients: contact 1√ó/month indefinitely; remain top-of-mind for referrals.

4) Prospecting & Time Blocking
- Daily: 1 hr Prospecting (new outreach) + 1 hr Follow-Up (nurtures, past clients, pipeline).
- Treat these as immovable calendar appointments.

5) Accountability & Metrics (tracked in FUB)
- Speed to Lead (‚â§ 5 min), 7 calls/7 days, video sent (Y/N), 2√ó/month cadence, 1√ó/month past clients, daily time blocks.
- Agents own consistency; reviewed weekly in 1:1s and sales meetings.

6) Lead Conversion Honor Code (commit to‚Ä¶)
- Never let a lead wait > 5 minutes; call 7√ó/7 days; send video to every lead;
- Follow up 2√ó/month (contacted leads); past clients 1√ó/month;
- Time block 2 hrs daily; use only FUB number + MG email.

================== LEAD MANAGEMENT PROCESS (STRUCTURE) ==================
Overview
- Lead management is a systematic way to follow up with contacts/clients after initial contact.
- Most sources (e.g., Ylopo) flow into FUB and are categorized/staged as they move through the pipeline.
‚ö†Ô∏è Biggest mistake: incorrect stage assignment. A buyer/seller must be emotionally, personally, and financially ready with achievable criteria before moving to certain stages.

Follow-Up Rhythm
- Dedicate ‚â• 1 hour/day to focused lead follow-up.

Lead Stages & When to Use Them (operational detail)
1. Lead ‚Äî new in FUB; immediate response required (Speed to Lead ‚â§ 5 min).
2. Attempted Contact ‚Äî attempted; needs ‚â• 3 outreach attempts (call/text/email).
3. Spoke with Customer ‚Äî contact made; add timeline, motivation, follow-up plan.
4. Appointment Set ‚Äî add date/time/details; put on calendar.
5. Met with Customer ‚Äî add outcome + next steps.
6. Showing Homes ‚Äî follow up after every showing.
7. Listing Agreement ‚Äî signed; begin pre-list (marketing prep, photography, etc.).
8. Active Listing ‚Äî live on MLS; weekly updates + marketing notes.
9. Submitting Offers ‚Äî track outcomes/negotiations.
10. Under Contract ‚Äî include key dates (closing, inspection, contingencies).
11. Nurture ‚Äî not ready now; set next follow-up + assign action plan.
12. Closed ‚Äî tag "Closed"; final note for testimonial/referral.
13. Trash ‚Äî unqualified/out of market/unresponsive; include reason note.
